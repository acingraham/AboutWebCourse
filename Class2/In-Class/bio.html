    <h1>My name is Andrew and I am About.com's Yo Mama Joke Expert.</h1>


    <h3>Here are my three favorite yo mama jokes:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Yo mama so stupid, she walked into an antique shop and asked, 'What's new?'</li>
        <li>Yo mama so fat, when she goes camping the bears have to hide <em>their</em> food</li>
        <li>They used to call it a jumpoline before yo mama got on it</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>My backstory:</h3>

    <p>I used to work as a developer at <a href="http://www.about.com">About.com</a>, but my bad jokes and <strong>grating</strong> voice during About.com's Web Development Course led to a petition demanding my immediate removal.  Now I write yo mama jokes for a living.</p>
